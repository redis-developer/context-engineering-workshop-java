# Context Engineering with LangChain4J Workshop

## Overview
Welcome to this hands-on workshop, where you'll learn to implement sophisticated context-engineering patterns. Context Engineering is the practice of strategically designing, structuring, and optimizing the information provided to AI models (particularly LLMs) to achieve desired outputs. It goes beyond using simple prompt engineering by considering the entire context window and how data is organized, presented, and sequenced to maximize model performance. In this workshop, you will learn how to implement this using [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), [LangChain4J](https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j), and [Redis](https://redis.io/).

### 🎯 What you'll build

By the end of this workshop, you'll have built a complete AI application featuring:
* LLM integration using OpenAI, Spring Boot, and LangChain4J
* Vector embeddings for semantic search with a chunking strategy
* RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with knowledge bases
* Dual-layer memory architecture (short-term and long-term memory)
* Query compression techniques for efficient context retrieval
* Content Reranking to optimize the relevance of retrieved information
* Few-shot learning pattern for improved generated responses
* Dynamic context window management based on token limits
* Semantic caching to optimize performance and reduce LLM costs

## 🗺️ Workshop Structure
This workshop is organized into 9 progressive labs, each building on the previous one.

| Lab | Topic                                                           | Duration | Branch                            |
|:----|:----------------------------------------------------------------|:---------|:----------------------------------
| 1   | Set up and deploy the AI application                            | 25 mins  | `lab-1-starter` |
| 2   | Enabling short-term memory with chat memory                     | 10 mins  | `lab-2-starter` |
| 3   | Knowledge base with embeddings, parsers, and splitters          | 10 mins  | `lab-3-starter` |
| 4   | Implementing basic RAG with knowledge base data                 | 20 mins  | `lab-4-starter` |
| 5   | Enabling on-demand context management for memories              | 10 mins  | `lab-5-starter` |
| 6   | Implementing query compression and context reranking            | 15 mins  | `lab-6-starter` |
| 7   | Implementing a few-shot into the system prompt design           | 05 mins  | `lab-7-starter` |
| 8   | Enabling token management to handle token limits                | 10 mins  | `lab-8-starter` |
| 9   | Implementing semantic caching for conversations                 | 25 mins  | `lab-9-starter` |

Each lab also contains a corresponding `lab-X-solution` branch with the completed code for reference. You can use this branch to compare your current implementation using `git diff {lab-X-solution}`. Alternatively, you can switch to the solution branch at any time during the lab if you are falling behind or to get unstuck.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/redis-developer/context-engineering-with-langchain4j-workshop.git
```

### Step 2: Verify your Environment
Ensure you have Java, Maven, Node.js, Docker, and Git installed. You can check their versions with:
```bash
java -version
